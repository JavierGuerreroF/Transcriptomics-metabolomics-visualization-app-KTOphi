<b>Interpreting the results table</b><br>

The results page displays a table that lists significant shared GO terms (or parents of GO terms) used to describe the set of genes , the background frequency, the sample frequency, expected p-value, an indication of over/underrepresentation for each term, and p-value. In addition, the results page displays all the criteria used in the analysis. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Background frequency and sample frequency.</b><br>

Background frequency is the number of genes annotated to a GO term in the entire background set, while sample frequency is the number of genes annotated to that GO term in the input list. For example, if the input list contains 10 genes and the enrichment is done for biological process in S. cerevisiae whose background set contains 6442 genes, then if 5 out of the 10 input genes are annotated to the GO term: DNA repair, then the sample frequency for DNA repair will be 5/10. Whereas if there are 100 genes annotated to DNA repair in all of the S. cerevisiae genome, then the background frequency will be 100/6442.
<br><br>

<b>P-value</b><br>


P-value is the probability or chance of seeing at least <b>x</b> number of genes out of the total <b>n</b> genes in the list annotated to a particular GO term, given the proportion of genes in the whole genome that are annotated to that GO Term. That is, the GO terms shared by the genes in the list are compared to the background distribution of annotation. The closer the p-value is to zero, the more significant the particular GO term associated with the group of genes is (i.e. the less likely the observed annotation of the particular GO term to a group of genes occurs by chance).<br>

In other words, when searching the process ontology, if all of the genes in a group were associated with “DNA repair”, this term would be significant. However, since all genes in the genome (with GO annotations) are indirectly associated with the top level term “biological_process”, this would not be significant if all the genes in a group were associated with this very high level term.<br>

<b>The adjustment of p-values</b><br>

The p-values return by the getSigGroups function are row p-values. There is no multiple testing correction
applied to them, unless the test statistic directly incorporate such a correction. Of course, the researcher
can perform an adjustment of the p-values if he considers it is important for the analysis. The reason for
not automatically correcting for multiple testing are:

<ul>
<li> <b>In many cases the row p-values return by an enrichment analysis are not that extreme. A FDR/FWER
adjustment procedure can in this case produce very conservative p-values and declare no, or very few,
terms as significant. </b>This is not necessary a bad thing, but it can happen that there are interesting
GO terms which didn't make it over the cutoff but they are omitted and thus valuable information
lost. In this case the researcher might be interested in the ranking of the GO terms even though no
top term is significant at a specify FDR level.
</li>
<li>
One should keep in mind that an enrichment analysis consist of many steps and there are many
assumptions done before applying, for example, Fisher's exact test on a set of GO terms. Performing
a multiple testing procedure accounting only on the number of GO terms is far from being enough to
control the error rate.
</li>
<li>
For the methods that account for the GO topology like elim and weight, the problem of multiple
testing is even more complicated. Here one computes the p-value of a GO term conditioned on the
neighbouring terms. The tests are therefore not independent and the multiple testing theory does not
directly apply. We like to interpret the p-values returned by these methods as corrected or not affected
by multiple testing.
</li>
</ul>
