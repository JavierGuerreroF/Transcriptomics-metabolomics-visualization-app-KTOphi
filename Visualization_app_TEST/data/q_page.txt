
Use the left panel to select the results from the Gene Ontology Enrichment and they will be displayed as a <b>table</b> (where you can click on the Gene Ontology ID for further information or in the row to see the significant genes for that ID) and as a <b>plot</b>.<br>
Select first the reference genome:

<ul>
<li><b>Ophiostoma</b> (Ophiostoma piceae)</li>
<li><b>KT</b> (Pseudomonas putida)</li>
</ul>

After that you can select the analisys, in other words the <b>contrast</b> between conditions:

<ul>
	<li>Treatment: <b>FaOH vs CTL</b></li>
	<li>Time: <b>early vs late</b></li>
	<li>Medium: <b>GPP vs BWP</b></li>
	<li>Organism VS consortium</li>
</ul>

In the first three analysis you can select if the organism analised is in consortium with the other.
