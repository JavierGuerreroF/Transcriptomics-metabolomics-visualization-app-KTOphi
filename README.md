<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# VISUALIZATION APP

This Shiny R app provides a comprehensive interface for visualizing and analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data. The app has three main tabs, each dedicated to different types of analyses: Volcano Plots, Gene Search, and Metabolomics.

You can acces throught the [shinyapp link here](https://jgf-bioinformatics.shinyapps.io/Visualization_app/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Usage

### 1. Volcano Plots Tab

### Screenshot:
![Volcano Plots Tab Screenshot](https://github.com/JavierGuerreroF/Transcriptomics-metabolomics-visualization-app-KTOphi/tree/main/images/volcano_plots.png?raw=true)

### Description:

This tab allows you to visualize differential expression analysis results through volcano plots.

   - Reference genome (Organism): Choose between different organisms (e.g., Ophiostoma or KT).
   - Analysis Options: Compare organism vs consortium, treatment effects (e.g., FaOH vs CTL), and time effects (early vs late).
   - Conditions Selection: Filter the data based on specific treatments and time points.
   - Volcano Plot Visualization: The plot displays log2 fold change vs -log10(p-value) with points colored by their differential expression status (upregulated, downregulated, or not significant).
   - Values Selection: Adjust log fold-change and p-value thresholds to filter significant genes.
   - Results Tables: Lists of over- and under-expressed genes with options to export the data.

### 2. Gene Search Tab

### Screenshot:

   - Analysis Options: Compare organism vs consortium, treatment effects (e.g., FaOH vs CTL), and time effects (early vs late).
